# Subtle Memory Management and Copying Issues in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Objective-C related to memory management and the use of copy vs. mutableCopy.  The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` offers a corrected version.  These examples highlight the importance of careful memory management and understanding the implications of copying mutable objects.  Improper handling can lead to memory leaks or unexpected data modifications.
