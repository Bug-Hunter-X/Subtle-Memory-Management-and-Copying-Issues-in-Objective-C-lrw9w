In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its counterpart, Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC).  Consider a scenario where an object is created and assigned to a property of another object. If the owning object is deallocated without properly releasing its reference to the owned object, a memory leak occurs. This might not immediately crash the app but will lead to performance degradation and instability over time. Another less apparent issue is with the use of `copy` vs. `mutableCopy`.  Incorrect use of these methods can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with mutable objects such as arrays or dictionaries where unintended modifications could occur. For instance, if you copy a mutable array but later modify the original, the copied array might exhibit unexpected changes.
